We show that T-Alg admits pseudo-limits and certain other limits, and that the inclusion 2-functor T-Algs → T-Alg has a left adjoint. We introduce the notion of flexible algebra, and use it to prove that T-Alg admits all bicolimits and that the 2-functor T-Alg → S-Alg induced by a monad-map S → T admits a left biadjoint.}

When V is equipped with the trivial model structure this recaptures the enriched version of Freyd's adjoint functor theorem. For non-trivial model structures, we obtain new adjoint functor theorems of a homotopical flavour — in particular, when V is the category of simplicial sets we obtain a homotopical adjoint functor theorem appropriate to the ∞-cosmoi of Riehl and Verity. We also investigate accessibility in the enriched setting, in particular obtaining homotopical cocompleteness results for accessible ∞-cosmoi.}

    abstract = "{2-Dimensional Categories provides an introduction to 2-categories and bicategories, assuming only the most elementary aspects of category theory. A review of basic category theory is followed by a systematic discussion of 2-/bicategories; pasting diagrams; lax functors; 2-/bilimits; the Duskin nerve; the 2-nerve; internal adjunctions; monads in bicategories; 2-monads; biequivalences; the Bicategorical Yoneda Lemma; and the Coherence Theorem for bicategories. Grothendieck fibrations and the Grothendieck construction are discussed next, followed by tricategories, monoidal bicategories, the Gray tensor product, and double categories. Completely detailed proofs of several fundamental but hard-to-find results are presented for the first time. With exercises and plenty of motivation and explanation, this book is useful for both beginners and experts.}",

author = {G.J. Bird and G.M. Kelly and A.J. Power and R.H. Street},
abstract = {Many important 2-categories — such as Lex, Fib/B, elementary toposes and logical morphisms, the dual of Grothendieck toposes and geometric morphisms, locally-presentable categories and left adjoints, the dual of this last, and the Makkai-Paré 2-category of accessible categories and accessible functors — fail to be complete, lacking even equalizers. These examples do in fact admit all bilimits — those weakenings of the limit notion that represent not by an isomorphism but only by an equivalence — but much more is true: they admit important classes of honest limits, including products, cotensor products, comma objects, Eilenberg-Moore objects, descent objects, inserters, equifiers, inverters, lax limits, pseudo limits, and idempotent-splitting. We introduce the class of flexible limits, which includes all of the above and is, in the technical sense, a closed class. Note that such honest limits, when they exist, have many advantages over bilimits: they are unique to within isomorphism, and their universal properties are both stronger and more convenient to use, a whole level of coherent families of invertible 2-cells being avoided.}

abstract = {Fibrations over a category B, introduced to category theory by Grothendieck, encode pseudo-functors Bop⇝Cat, while the special case of discrete fibrations encodes presheaves Bop→Set. A two-sided discrete variation encodes functors Bop×A→Set, which are also known as profunctors from A to B. By work of Street, all of these fibration notions can be defined internally to an arbitrary 2-category or bicategory. While the two-sided discrete fibrations model profunctors internally to Cat, unexpectedly, the dual two-sided codiscrete cofibrations are necessary to model V-profunctors internally to V-Cat.}
